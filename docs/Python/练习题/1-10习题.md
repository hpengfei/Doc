### Question 1

Question: Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

问题:编写一个程序，找出2000和3200之间(包括两者)所有能被7整除但不是5的倍数的数字。获得的数字应以逗号分隔的序列打印在单行上。 

Hints: Consider use range(#begin, #end) method

```python
result_list = []
for i in range(2000, 3201):
    if i % 7 == 0 and i % 5 != 0:
        result_list.append(str(i))
    else:
        continue

print(','.join(result_list))
```

Question: Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers. The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be: 40320

问:写一个程序可以计算一个给定数字的阶乘。结果应该以逗号分隔的序列打印在一行上。假设向程序提供了以下输入:8那么，输出应该是:40320 

Hints: In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
